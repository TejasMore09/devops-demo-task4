# Dummy DevOps Project
This project, titled DevOps Demo Project, has been created as part of TASK 4 to demonstrate practical usage of Git and GitHub for version control in a DevOps workflow. The aim is to simulate a real-world development environment by following industry-standard Git practices like branching, merging via pull requests, semantic version tagging, and markdown-based documentation.

The repository is organized with a basic structure that includes key files like .gitignore (to avoid tracking unnecessary files), Dockerfile (as a placeholder for containerization), Jenkinsfile (to represent CI/CD configuration), a README.md for documentation, and a docs folder containing task-log.md to record all tasks completed.

This project follows a clean branching strategy:

The main branch holds stable, production-ready code.

The dev branch is used for ongoing development and integration.

Individual feature-* branches are created for isolated tasks or enhancements, like updating the README or adding a new module.

Throughout the task, Git commands such as git init, git branch, git checkout, git add, git commit, git push, and git tag were used. Pull requests were used to merge feature branches into dev, reinforcing collaboration workflows. A version tag v1.0 was added to mark the first stable state of the project.

This README file helps guide contributors on how to clone the project, create feature branches, push changes, and open pull requests. It also documents the versioning information and project structure, ensuring clarity for future users or evaluators.
